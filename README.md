# Route Timer #

This app helps you determine which route between two destinations is the fastest based on your own measured data.

A **trip** is traveling from A to B, e.g. Home to Work. Going the other direction (B to A) would be a separate trip.

A **route** is a particular path or method of travel for the selected trip, as long as it's consistent day to day. For example, one route could be taking the freeway home, and another for taking the backroads.

To start, add a trip and route you want to measure, start the timer, then stop it when you arrive. For best results, make the start and stop points the same across all routes, e.g. starting when you get in the car, and stopping when parked at work.

Each route will need several records in order to produce a good average. If you forget to stop the timer or otherwise need to clear an entry, you can do so with the 'Ã—' button to the right of an entry in the Trip Log.

The app does not need to stay open while the timer is running, and no data is ever transmitted anywhere. You can export the data as JSON for further analysis, or clear everything from your device at any time.
